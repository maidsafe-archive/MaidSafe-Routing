// having an Address or NodeInfo arg will throw if NDEBUG is defined and the passed ID is invalid.

// function throws.  Other than bad_allocs, there are no other exceptions thrown from this class.

  // 1 - if the contact is ourself, or doesn't have a valid public key, or is already in the table,
  //     it will not be added
  // 2 - if the routing table is not full (size < OptimalSize()), the contact will be added

  // 4 - if we can find a candidate for removal (a contact in a bucket with more than 'BucketSize()'
  //     contacts, which is also not within our close group), and if the new contact will fit in a
